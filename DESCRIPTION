Description: An R port of the 'GGML' library providing efficient tensor
    operations for machine learning on CPU and GPU. Implements core functionality
    of 'GGML', including element-wise arithmetic, tensor manipulation, and
    multi-GPU support via Vulkan backend scheduler. The package brings the
    lightweight and performance-oriented design of 'GGML' to the R environment
    for fast numerical computation and model prototyping.
    See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml> for more information
    about the underlying library.
